Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead is the day when dead ancestors are celebrated. This celebration happens over the course of  two days, from October 31, to Novermber 2. During this time, offerings are left at ancestors graves. These could include sugar skulls, or pictures of the specific relative. Ofrendas, or altars to the dead often adorn family members' houses. Click <a href="https://www.latinoartsinc.org/exhibits/dia-de-los-muertos-ofrendas/">here</a> for more information on ofrendas. This celebration is more positive, and a time for remebering the happy moments, instead of a sad, depressing time to wallow in your own sadness</h3></p>
